# 🖌️ Handwritten Digit Recognition using CNN & Streamlit

This project is a **Handwritten Digit Recognition Web App** built using:

- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **Streamlit**
- **MNIST Dataset**

Users can upload an image of a handwritten digit (0–9), and the trained CNN model will predict the digit with high accuracy.
